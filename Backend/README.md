## Introduction

Nifty is an online service marketplace that connects contractors with customers seeking specific contractual services. This platform provides a convenient and efficient way for contractors to showcase their expertise and for customers to find reliable and skilled professionals. By leveraging the power of technology, Nifty aims to streamline the process of hiring contractors while empowering customers to make informed decisions.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment
- Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js

## Coding Styles and Standards

### General

- Follow the principles of clean code to ensure readability and maintainability.
- Write modular and reusable code to promote scalability and code reuse.
- Aim for consistency in coding style and structure throughout the project.

### Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, classes, and modules.
- Follow camelCase naming convention for variables and functions.
- Use PascalCase for class names and constructor functions.
- Prefix private variables and functions with an underscore `_`.

### Code Formatting

- Use consistent indentation (e.g., 2 spaces or tabs) for code blocks.
- Ensure proper spacing around operators, commas, and parentheses to improve readability.
- Limit line length to 80-100 characters to prevent horizontal scrolling.
- Use meaningful comments to explain complex logic or clarify code when necessary.
- Space after every container tag

### Error Handling

- Implement proper error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle exceptions and errors.
- Use try-catch blocks to capture synchronous errors and handle them appropriately.
- Utilize error middleware or error-handling functions to manage asynchronous errors.
- Provide informative error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes for API endpoints.

### Logging

- Log relevant information, warnings, and errors to aid in debugging and troubleshooting.
- Use structured logging formats to facilitate log analysis and monitoring.
- Configure logging levels (e.g., debug, info, warn, error) based on severity and verbosity.

### Testing

- Write comprehensive unit tests to validate the functionality of individual components.
- Use testing frameworks such as Jest, Mocha, or Jasmine for writing and executing tests.
- Implement integration tests to verify interactions between different modules or services.
- Aim for high test coverage to minimize the risk of regressions and ensure code quality.

## Installation and Running the project locally
1. Have VS code or any IDE of choice.
2. Have node js and npm installed.
3. Open the project, to run server type in cd backend and then run node server
4. The project will be running on http://localhost:3000/

## Usage

Explain how to run the project locally and provide any additional usage instructions. Include examples of API endpoints or functionality if applicable.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to enhance the functionality and usability of Nifty. To contribute, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.(for backend features start branch with backend- / for frontend start with frontend-)
3. Make the necessary changes and ensure that the existing tests pass.
4. Test your changes thoroughly to maintain the overall quality of the project.
5. Commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.
6. Submit a pull request, describing the changes you have made and the problem it solves.
7. The figma screens are located in the wireframe folder should you need them.
